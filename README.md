# Encryption
Create an index.jsp page that asks the user to enter a string of text data, and to make a choice of two hash functions using radio buttons. The hash function choices should be MD5 and SHA-256, with MD5 being the default. When the submit button is pressed a request is sent to a servlet. The servlet must be named ComputeHashes.java. The servlet will compute the requested cryptographic hash value (MD5 or SHA-256) from the text transmitted by the browser. You will need to employ the Java crypto API to compute the hash of the text. The original text will be echoed back to the browser along with the name of the hash, and the hash value. The hash values sent back to the browser should be displayed in two forms: as hexadecimal text and as base 64 notation.
